c-rbtree - Intrusive Red-Black Tree Collection

ABOUT:
        The c-rbtree project implements an intrusive collection based on
        red-black trees in ISO-C11. Its API guarantees the user full control
        over its data-structures, and rather limits itself to just the
        tree-specific rebalancing and coloring operations.

        For API documentation, see the c-rbtree.h header file, as well as the
        docbook comments for each function.

REQUIREMENTS:
        The requirements for c-siphash are:

            libc (e.g., glibc >= 2.16)

        At build-time, the following software is required:

            meson >= 0.41
            pkg-config >= 0.29

INSTALL:
        The meson build-system is used for this project. Contact upstream
        documentation for detailed help. In most situations the following
        commands are sufficient to build and install from source:

            $ mkdir build
            $ cd build
            $ meson setup ..
