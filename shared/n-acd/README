n-acd - IPv4 Address Conflict Detection

ABOUT:
        The n-acd project implements the IPv4 Address Conflict Detection
        standard as defined in RFC-5227. The state machine is implemented in a
        shared library and provides a stable ISO-C11 API. The implementation is
        linux-only and relies heavily on the API behavior of recent linux
        kernel releases.
