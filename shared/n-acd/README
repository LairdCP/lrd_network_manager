n-acd - IPv4 Address Conflict Detection

ABOUT:
        The n-acd project implements the IPv4 Address Conflict Detection
        standard as defined in RFC-5227. The state machine is implemented in a
        shared library and provides a stable ISO-C11 API. The implementation is
        linux-only and relies heavily on the API behavior of recent linux
        kernel releases.

REQUIREMENTS:
        The requirements for n-acd are:

            Linux kernel >= 3.19
            libc (e.g., glibc >= 2.16)

        At build-time, the following software is required:

            meson >= 0.41
            pkg-config >= 0.29

INSTALL:
        The meson build-system is used for this project. Contact upstream
        documentation for detailed help. In most situations the following
        commands are sufficient to build and install from source:

            $ mkdir build
            $ cd build
            $ meson setup ..
            $ ninja
            $ meson test
            # ninja install

        For custom configuration options see meson_options.txt.
